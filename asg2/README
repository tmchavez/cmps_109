known bugs:
"cd  " command does not retur to root, but "cd .." goes
to parent

warnings during compile are only due to unused parameters in overloaded
functions in plain_file and directoy

ls call only prints for current directory

memory leak due to rm not removing all things in directory when
the directory is removed

lsr and rmr not fully implemented, just implemted as
ls and rm respectively
